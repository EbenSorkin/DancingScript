# Dancing Script

Dancing Script is a lively casual script where the letters bounce and change size slightly. Caps are big, and goes below the baseline.

Dancing Script references popular scripts typefaces from the 50's.

It relates to Murray Hill (Emil Klumpp. 1956) in his weight distribution, and to Mistral (Roger Excoffon. 1953) in his lively bouncing effect.

Use it when you want a friendly, informal and spontaneous look.
